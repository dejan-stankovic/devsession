# DevSession Backend

TLDR: You're probably looking for the [readme of the main repo](https://github.com/lukasbach/devsession).

This package contains the backend for the collaborative webbased IDE [devsession](https://devsession.js.org).
The package is organized as part of a monorepo located at 
[https://github.com/lukasbach/devsession](https://github.com/lukasbach/devsession).
Follow the instructions there to setup and run the backend for development purposes.

If you just want to run the devsession application, run ``npx devsession`` in the directory in which
you want to host the coding session or download prebuilt binaries from [here](https://github.com/lukasbach/devsession/releases).
